# Gateway latency report

CI measures **gateway-added latency** against a local OpenAI-compatible mock.
It does not call paid providers, does not require secrets, and does not claim
end-to-end model latency.

The static research writeup in `docs/research/rust-gateway-engine.md` remains
the source for high-concurrency native-engine evidence. This page documents the
routine CI report only.

## What is measured

The runner starts a loopback mock, then measures the same
`/v1/chat/completions` payload against:

1. the mock directly
2. the Experiential native gateway

The gateway aliases the public model name `latency` to the same mock, so the
request body is identical. The report records gateway p50, p95, and p99, and
also the client-observed difference versus the mock for those percentiles.

The schedule is:

- warmup requests are discarded before the timed window
- mock-direct and gateway arms run sequentially, not in parallel
- percentiles use nearest-rank selection
- the representative result is the median run by gateway p50

Streaming time-to-first-token is included because the mock emits the first
content token immediately, so TTFT is a simple first-byte measurement rather
than a model-generation race.

## Commands

Local report:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run python -m exp.runtime.gateway.latency_report \
  --output-json gateway-latency.json \
  --output-badge shields/gateway-latency.json
```

Focused tests:

```bash
uv run pytest -q exp/runtime/gateway/latency_report_test.py \
  exp/runtime/gateway/latency_measure_test.py \
  exp/runtime/gateway/latency_badge_test.py
```

The workflow `.github/workflows/gateway-latency.yml` runs on every push to
`main`, on pull requests, and via `workflow_dispatch`. Pull requests and pushes
use `ubuntu-latest`. An explicit `workflow_dispatch` uses the larger hosted
runner `gateway-benchmark-32core`. Functional request failures fail the job.
There is no hard latency threshold.

## Artifact

The job uploads `gateway-latency.json` with schema
`exp.gateway.latency_report` version 1, plus the derived Shields endpoint
`shields/gateway-latency.json`. It also writes a Markdown table to the GitHub
Actions job summary. The report records the commit SHA, runner OS, CPU count
and model, Python version, resolved Experiential engine, every repeat, and the
median run by gateway non-stream p50.

## Numeric latency badge

The root README shows the latest **representative gateway p50 request
latency** (`representative_run.gateway.p50_ms`) from a successful routine run
on `main`. The badge is a Shields endpoint, not a GitHub Actions pass/fail
status image. The label is `gateway latency` and the message is the measured
value, for example `22.2 ms`.

After each successful `push` to `main`, the workflow publishes
`gateway-latency.json` on the `badges` branch. Pull requests and
`workflow_dispatch` (including the 32-core runner) measure and upload the
artifact but do not publish the badge. That branch is not `main`, so the
update does not require a protected-branch push and does not start gate,
latency, or package workflows.

Stable endpoint:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/experientiallabs/experiential/badges/gateway-latency.json`

README image:

```markdown
[![gateway latency](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fexperientiallabs%2Fexperiential%2Fbadges%2Fgateway-latency.json)](https://github.com/experientiallabs/experiential/actions/workflows/gateway-latency.yml?query=branch%3Amain)
```

The `badges` branch is created by the first successful main run after this
workflow lands. Until that run finishes, the Shields image may render as
invalid. Later successful main runs overwrite the same public file.

## The first-token stall bound

Two fail-fast allowances bound the start of every physical attempt, both absolute from the
dial and both per-deployment overridable through the gateway capabilities:

- **Headers**: `time_to_first_byte_seconds` (15 s) plus
  `time_to_first_byte_seconds_per_million_input_tokens` (240) bounds the wait for the
  provider's response headers (`upstream::open_stream`; overrides
  `time_to_first_byte_base_seconds` / `time_to_first_byte_seconds_per_million_input_tokens`).
- **First token**: `time_to_first_token_seconds` (120 s, clamped to three quarters of the
  request budget so a stall can still fail over: under the engine's own 120 s request
  timeout the effective default is 90 s; the platform's 1500 s budget keeps the full
  allowance) plus the same input slope bounds the wait, in the relay, until the waterfall
  COMMITS the attempt on its first semantic event
  (`is_semantic`: content, reasoning, a tool call, an output item; override
  `time_to_first_token_base_seconds`). `UpstreamRelay::commit` disarms it at that point and
  nowhere else, so a refusal delta withheld under refusal failover leaves it armed.

Response headers, SSE keepalive comments, Anthropic pings and role-only frames satisfy neither
bound's *token* half: on 2026-09-19 a lane answered all of those at once and then stalled ~2
minutes before its first token, and the old single bound, satisfied by the first body byte,
let the request sit on the 60 s per-chunk timeout while it held a worker permit. The
first-token base is two minutes rather than the header bound's fifteen seconds because a
thinking model on a chat wire streams nothing until its first content token: over the seven
days before the change, 6% of gpt-5.6-sol's completions (p99 94 s) and 1-3% of most other
healthy lanes took longer than the header allowance to produce a token, while the stalled
lane's medians sat above two minutes. A stall past the allowance is
`first_byte_timeout_failure()`: class `timeout`, failover-eligible, never redialed on the
stalled lane, so the ladder advances before anything has reached the caller. Once the
attempt is committed the bound is disarmed and reads are paced by the deployment's per-chunk
timeout, so a slow reasoning model streams for as long as it needs. `time_to_first_byte_ms`
in the metrics still records the first body byte; `first_token_at` on the attempt records
the first output token.
