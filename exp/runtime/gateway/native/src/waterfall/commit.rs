//! The commit predicate: the first event that makes an attempt the answer.
//!
//! An attempt is COMMITTED on its first semantic event -- the first sign of
//! the model's own output (content, reasoning, a tool call, an output item)
//! rather than stream scaffolding (role-only chunks, pings, keepalive
//! comments, usage). Before commit a failure fails over to the next rung;
//! after it the attempt is the response and a failure is the caller's. The
//! relay's fail-fast first-token bound is disarmed by the waterfall at the
//! commit (`UpstreamRelay::commit`), never by the relay on its own, so the two
//! agree on the moment a stall stops being failover-eligible -- including a
//! refusal delta that is semantic here but WITHHELD under refusal failover.
