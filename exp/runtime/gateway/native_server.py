    """Serve the native data plane until a stop signal, blocking this thread.

    Args:
        control_plane: Shared authority and accounting callbacks.
        host: Public listener host.
        port: Public listener port.
        max_active_requests: Native concurrent-admission bound.
        graceful_timeout_seconds: Bound for graceful shutdown.
        connect_timeout_seconds: Fail-fast bound on the TCP+TLS connect phase
            of every provider call, so a lane whose host never accepts the
            connection fails over in seconds instead of hanging on the
            per-deployment request timeout.
        time_to_first_byte_seconds: Fail-fast bound on the wait for a
            provider's response headers per attempt (the flat part; the
            input-scaled allowance below is added). Deployments may
            override it through their gateway capabilities.
        time_to_first_byte_seconds_per_million_input_tokens: Input-scaled
            first-byte allowance added on top of the flat bound, in seconds
            per million approximate input tokens (request bytes over four),
            so a very large prompt's prefill is not misread as a dead lane.
            Added to both the header and the first-token bounds.
            Deployments may override it through their gateway capabilities.
        time_to_first_token_seconds: Fail-fast bound on the wait for a
            provider's first TOKEN per attempt: the first semantic event
            (content, reasoning, a tool call), absolute from the dial, with
            the same input-scaled allowance added. Response headers, SSE
            keepalive comments and role-only frames do not satisfy it (a
            lane that sends those at once and then stalls for minutes is
            exactly the case it exists for), and a thinking model on a chat
            wire streams nothing until its first content token, so the
            default is two minutes rather than the header bound's fifteen
            seconds (clamped to three quarters of ``request_timeout_seconds``
            so the stall is caught while the request can still fail over).
            It never caps total generation time: once the attempt
            commits, reads are paced by the deployment's own per-chunk
            timeout. A stall fails over to the next rung. Deployments may
            override the flat bound through their gateway capabilities.
        native_usage_enabled: Whether Rust owns ``/usage.json``. Hosted,
            multi-tenant callers should disable it so their own surface owns
            usage.
        shutdown: Optional embedder-owned stop handle from
            ``exp_gateway_native.shutdown_handle()``. A host serving on a
            background thread calls ``request_shutdown()`` to stop the plane
            gracefully, since threads cannot receive SIGINT.
        on_listening: Optional callback the native server invokes exactly
            once, after its listener socket is bound and queuing
            connections and before any request is accepted, so the embedder
            can announce readiness truthfully. A callback failure aborts
            the launch.

    Raises:
        NativeGatewayServerError: The extension is unavailable or the native
            server fails.
