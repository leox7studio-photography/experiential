"""Route admission with disclosed coercion for the native control plane.

Admission prefers rungs that preserve every caller semantic verbatim: the
generation-control narrowing and the per-deployment capability preflight plus
payload build both run here. When no rung preserves the request verbatim,
this module applies the capability-preservation policy's minimal disclosed
coercion exactly once per layer and re-selects; when nothing coercible
remains, the first rung's own field-scoped rejection stays the answer. A
coercion is never
silent: every substitution is disclosed through ``ignored_parameters`` in
``path->effective`` form, warn-logged for operators, and counted in the
admission metrics.
