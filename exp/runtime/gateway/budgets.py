"""How far below a long-context threshold the input estimate may sit and still
reserve at the premium schedule.

The input reservation is a realistic estimate with headroom, not an upper
bound, so an estimate just under the threshold can settle just over it and
be repriced for the WHOLE request (the tier doubles Gemini's rates above
200k). The reservation therefore treats the tier as reachable inside this
band below the threshold: a request estimated at 160k+ tokens against a 200k
tier reserves at premium rates and settles at whatever schedule the provider
actually applied. The cost of the rule is a one-attempt over-reservation of
roughly the tier multiple inside the band; without it a hard monthly budget
could be overdrawn by the same multiple on a threshold-straddling request.
