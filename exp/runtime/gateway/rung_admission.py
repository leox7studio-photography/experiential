"""In-process bounded, rate-limited, weighted fair-share admission per rung.

One registry per worker tracks in-flight dispatches on rungs that author a
``GatewayRungDispatchPolicy``: a rung at its per-worker ``concurrency_bound``
sheds new dispatches down the waterfall (spill in seconds, never a queue that
dies at the request deadline), a rung past its sliding-window request or
token rate sheds the same way BEFORE the provider answers 429, and a
``fair_share`` rung additionally bounds each organization's admissions by its
weighted max-min share while the rung is contended. Every decision is
lock-guarded in-memory arithmetic over counters this registry already holds:
no database read, no shared state, no waiting.

Rate calibration is passive-adaptive: a provider throttle clamps the rung's
working request rate to ninety percent of the rate actually observed at that
moment, and the working ceiling then creeps back up by five percent every
recovery interval without a throttle (each creep step IS the probe: a few
more requests go through to see whether they make it further this time). A
learned ceiling that sees no throttle for the expiry horizon is forgotten.
There are never synthetic probe requests, only real traffic let through.

Fairness is deliberately conservative because there is no queue and no
preemption. Capacity below the bound is always borrowable (work-conserving: a
lone organization uses the whole rung), and an organization above its weighted
share is shed only when admitting it would eat capacity currently reserved for
another RECENTLY ACTIVE under-share organization. A shed marks its organization
active, so a flooded-out organization accrues a reservation and converges to
its share as slots free, without ever pausing a running request. When a rung
authors ``cache_priority_alpha``, each organization's effective weight scales
with the rung's congestion and the worker's EWMA of that organization's
settled cached-token fraction, so at the contended margin cache-heavy traffic
is admitted ahead of cold traffic.
