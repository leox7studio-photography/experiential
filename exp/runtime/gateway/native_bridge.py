"""Python control plane for the native (Rust) gateway data plane.

The native engine (`exp_gateway_native`) owns sockets, upstream streaming,
normalization, and SSE encoding. Shared Python contracts own decoding,
authorization, payload construction, continuation state, and durable ledger
transactions. Every boundary call takes and returns one JSON string.
Admission returns the full ordered certified route (one wire configuration
per deployment) plus the frozen retry-policy facts, accepting the request
without starting any attempt. The data plane then reserves each physical
dispatch through ``start_attempt`` immediately before network work and lands
each attempt's durable terminal through ``settle`` (finalizing the request
only on the terminal attempt); candidate selection stays here: the frozen
waterfall policy, health circuits, and budget skipping.
Boundary errors raise :class:`NativeBridgeError`, whose ``public_error_json``
attribute carries the sanitized OpenAI-shaped error the data plane returns to
the caller through the shared boundary mapping. Requests the native path
cannot serve (resolved clients exposing no native wire profile) are answered
with an ``{"escalate": reason}`` admission disposition after the accepted
request is finalized content-free; the data plane classifies the reason for
metrics and fails the request closed with the shared internal error.
