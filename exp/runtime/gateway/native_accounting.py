"""Durable attempt accounting for the native data plane's waterfall.

One registry owns every admitted request from acceptance to its terminal
settlement: it reserves each physical dispatch (``start_attempt``), lands each
attempt's durable terminal (``settle``), terminalizes requests with no
settleable outcome (``abandon``), and sweeps retained settlements and
abandoned reservations on a timer. Candidate selection enforces the frozen
waterfall policy, including deployment-health circuits and per-deployment
budget skipping. Every method takes and returns one JSON
string, matching the bridge boundary.
