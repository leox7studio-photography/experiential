"""Per-reservation dispatch-policy decisions for the native waterfall.

The accounting bridge reserves every physical dispatch immediately before
network work; these helpers make the two policy decisions it needs at that
moment without owning state of their own. ``reserve_rung_slot`` asks the
worker's load registry whether a policy-bounded rung admits the dispatch or
sheds it sideways, folding in the affinity pool's warm-session standing.
``failed_dispatch_candidate`` turns a classified failure into the ladder's
next candidate, reading the requesting organization's observed cached
fraction on the failed rung so a pool authoring ``throttle_cache_threshold``
can dispose of a throttle by the cache actually at stake, and honoring a
post-backoff redial under an authored ``throttle_redial`` schedule.
``throttle_redial_budgets`` applies the same cache-stakes gate at
admission, per rung, so the data plane knows how long each rung is worth
waiting on before the first throttle arrives.

    """Size, per rung, how many post-backoff redials this request may spend there.

    Read once at admission so the data plane knows before the first throttle
    how long each rung is worth waiting on. Every budget is zero on a pool
    without a ``throttle_redial`` schedule (the historical failover-only
    throttle). With a schedule and no ``throttle_cache_threshold`` every rung
    gets the schedule's full ``max_attempts``: the operator asked for backoff
    on this pool. With both, the budget is decided rung by rung under three
    rules, in this order:

    1. No cold alternative: the LAST rung of the admitted route gets the full
       ``max_attempts`` regardless of cache evidence. ``route`` is the route
       as admitted, already narrowed to the rungs that are live and can serve
       this request, and a throttle advances cold only to later rungs, so a
       throttle on the last rung has nowhere to fail over. A zero budget
       there would surface the 429 at once while a bounded wait could still
       have served the request. A single-rung route is the same case.
    2. Warm sticky session: the rung the request's affinity fingerprint is
       bound to in the worker's ``StickySpillRegistry``
       (``sticky_deployment_id``) gets the full ``max_attempts``. The binding
       is direct evidence that the conversation's provider cache lives on
       that rung, the same warm standing ``reserve_rung_slot`` honors. The
       issuing rung of a reasoning continuation
       (``route.reasoning_pinned_deployment_id``) is the same case: it alone
       can replay the request's thinking, so failing over past it costs the
       turn's continuity as well as its cache, and it waits the whole
       schedule before its fallbacks are tried.
    3. Otherwise the budget scales with the cache at stake: the full
       ``max_attempts`` when the requesting organization's observed cached
       fraction on the rung meets the threshold, a proportional share
       (``floor(max_attempts * fraction / threshold)``) below it, and zero
       with no cache evidence, so a request with little to lose fails over
       sooner and one with nothing to lose fails over at once.

    Rules 1 and 2 exist because the fraction rule 3 reads is the WORKER-LOCAL
    time-decayed EWMA of the organization's settled cached fraction on the
    rung: it is zero when the organization has no live sample on this worker
    (a throttled attempt settles without usage, and a conversation trickling
    a few requests per hour across many workers leaves most of them without
    one) even when the same conversation is over ninety percent cached at the
    provider. Missing evidence must therefore never zero the budget when
    waiting is the only move (rule 1) or the obviously right one (rule 2).
    The fraction is the admission-time EWMA, at most seconds older than the
    reading a failure-time decision would take.

    Args:
        loads: The worker's per-rung load registry holding the cache EWMA.
        route: The admitted route, narrowed to the rungs that can serve this
            request, in dispatch order.
