"""Worker protection against one slow lane holding every admission permit.

A gateway worker admits at most ``max_active_requests`` requests at once (the
data plane's permit semaphore); a request past that waits for a permit until
its own deadline. On 2026-09-19 one tier-4 organization sent ~100 requests a
minute to a model whose lead rung degraded to a two-minute first token; the
rung authored no ``concurrency_bound``, so 270-430 of its requests sat in
flight, held every permit on every worker, and EVERY route on the gateway
(other models, ``/v1/models``) waited minutes at the edge while CPU stayed at
30-60% and nothing scaled.

Two rules close that:

1. The DEFAULT LANE BOUND. A rung that authors no ``concurrency_bound`` is
   bounded anyway, per worker, at ``default_lane_bound(max_active_requests)``:
   a fixed share (``DEFAULT_LANE_SHARE``) of the worker's permits, so one
   physical lane can never hold them all. Past it the request spills to the
   next rung exactly like an authored bound (``queue_bound``). An authored
   ``concurrency_bound`` replaces the default on its rung, higher or lower.
2. REFUSAL INSTEAD OF OVERFLOW. When every rung of a pool is at its bound the
   accounting used to force-admit past the first shed rung
   (``saturated_overflow``: "policy never manufactures a failure"). That is
   still the default for an AUTHORED bound, and an authored rung may opt into
   ``saturation="refuse"``; the default lane bound always refuses, because a
   protective bound that overflows protects nothing. A refusal is a fast,
   retryable 429 (``lane_saturated_failure``) with the protocol's throttle
   Retry-After, answered
   before any dispatch, so the caller's retry lands when a slot frees rather
   than queueing behind the slow lane.
