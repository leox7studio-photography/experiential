Version 5 identifies populated cache-write capability and 5-minute/1-hour

Every change that alters the IDENTITY serialization of the normalized catalog
MUST bump this in the same PR (the pinned-digest change-detector test enforces
it). Since version 3 the identity serialization excludes every field that holds
its declared default, so ADDING a defaulted field to any model in the catalog
graph does not alter identity and needs no bump; changing a default, renaming
or removing a field, or changing normalization output still does. A rolling
deploy runs two builds at once; a stored snapshot whose ``schema_version``
differs from this constant is a cross-version skew that the reader serves
through the tolerant path (its own leniently parsed view keyed by the pinned
digest) instead of a digest rejection, so no request ever hard-fails mid-roll.
When the versions match, the byte-exact digest checks stay strict, preserving
corruption detection.

    the digest checks stay strict, so same-version corruption still fails closed.

    Serving a foreign snapshot is unverified by construction: this build cannot
